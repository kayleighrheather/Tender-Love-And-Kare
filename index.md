## Let's Bring Your Furniture Restoration Vision to Life!

Sick of the coffee stains on your table?

Tired of the scratches, chips and general fading on your dresser, bedside table or desk?

My name is Kayleigh Heather and I am an engineering student at Virginia Tech. In my free time I love to refurbish and refinish furniture. Anything from a small touch up to a large project, nothing is beyond my reach!

Some of my skills include:
- Restaining
- Repainting
- Sanding
- Distressing (Applying a distressed look)
- Refinishing
- Antiquing
- Accenting
- Leveling
- And more!

I can and have worked on furniture pieces such as:
- Desks
- Dressers
- Tables
- Jewelry Boxes

Below you will see some of the work that I have done. If anthing catches your eye and you would like more pictures, let me know. 

I even have a truck, so **pick-up and drop off would be a breeze!**

Let me know if you are interested, I would **love to make your vision come to life!**
