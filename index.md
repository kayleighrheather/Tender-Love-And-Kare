My name is Kayleigh Heather and I am an engineering student at Virginia Tech. In my free time I love to refurbish and refinish furniture. Anything from a small touch up to a large project, nothing is beyond my reach!

```
Some of my skills include:
- Restaining
- Repainting
- Sanding
- Distressing (Applying a distressed look)
- Refinishing
- Antiquing
- Accenting
- Leveling
- And more!


I can and have worked on furniture pieces such as:
- Desks
- Dressers
- Tables
- Jewelry Boxes
```

Below you will see some of the work that I have done. If anthing catches your eye and you would like more pictures, let me know. 


I even have a truck, so **pick-up and drop off would be a breeze!**


Let me know if you are interested, I would **love to make your vision come to life!**
